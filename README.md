# Volunteer Portal - currently not named

A volunteer portal to support directory and record keeping, induction and onboarding processes, and just general everyday operations specifically for MYND Initiative Inc. Built as a part of INCO Academy's INCODE bootcamp and designed to be used by non-profits.


## Current requests

[ ] Role-based users
[ ] Document signing and uploading
[X] Volunteer hour logging - can log other people's hours
[ ] Check for overlapping logs
[X] Links to Slack, Email, Drive, Trello
[ ] Inviting new members to Slack, Google Drive & Trello - non-priority
[X] User directory
[ ] Policy directory
[X] The ability for users to update their details
[ ] The ability for volunteers to go on leave/quit - non priority
[ ] The ability for volunteers to request employment - non-priority
[ ] The ability to schedule online meetings with others - non-priority


## Current phase

Taking feature requests and currently in design.

## TODO

[ ] Hour logging validation
[ ] Fix editing logs
[ ] File upload validation
[ ] Avatar cropping and resizing
[ ] Onboarding page
[ ] Induction page
[ ] Portal Settings page
[ ] Policies page - look into google drive API
[ ] Option to drag and reorder nav

## Follow up questions

[ ] If users are likely to be using the platform for hours at a time (leave it open in order to log hours), will I need a paid tier of Heroku? And will JWT kick them out if it's set to expire earlier?
